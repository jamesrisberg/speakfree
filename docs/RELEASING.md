## 1. Prerequisites and tools

| Tool | Install | Purpose |
|------|---------|---------|
| Xcode (latest stable) | App Store | `xcrun`, `codesign`, `notarytool`, `stapler` |
| `create-dmg` | `brew install create-dmg` | Builds the distributable DMG |
| `gh` | `brew install gh` | Creates the draft GitHub release |
| Sparkle cask | `brew install --cask sparkle` | `sign_update` and `generate_keys` binaries |
| shellcheck | `brew install shellcheck` | Validates release scripts (CI gate) |

Sparkle is installed as a cask into `/opt/homebrew/Caskroom/sparkle/<version>/bin/`.
`build.sh` discovers the version dynamically (see §3).

---

## 2. Keychain profiles and credentials

Three credentials are required to build a signed, notarized, published release.
All live in the macOS login keychain on the release machine.

### 2a. Developer ID certificate — `Developer ID Application: Michael Morgenstern (AZ53Y7V4UZ)`

**What it is:** The code-signing certificate issued by Apple for distributing
outside the Mac App Store.

**Where it lives:** macOS login keychain. Verify with:

```
security find-certificate -c "Developer ID Application: Michael Morgenstern" -p
```

**What it signs:** every binary and framework inside `speakfree.app`, and the
app bundle itself.

**Recovery:** see §5a.

### 2b. Notarization profile — `speakfree-notary`

**What it is:** A `notarytool` keychain profile that stores the Apple ID
credentials (email + App Store Connect API key *or* app-specific password) used
to submit DMGs to Apple's notarization service.

**Where it lives:** macOS login keychain, under the profile name
`speakfree-notary`. Inspect with:

```
xcrun notarytool store-credentials --validate --keychain-profile speakfree-notary
```

**Recovery:** see §5b.

### 2c. Sparkle EdDSA signing key

**What it is:** An Ed25519 key pair. The private key signs each DMG during
`build.sh`; the public key is embedded in `Resources/Info.plist` as
`SUPublicEDKey` so Sparkle can verify updates on the user's machine.

**Where the private key lives:** macOS login keychain, stored by Sparkle's
`generate_keys` tool. The key label Sparkle uses is
`"Sparkle <public-key-base64>"`. Retrieve with:

```
/opt/homebrew/Caskroom/sparkle/$(ls /opt/homebrew/Caskroom/sparkle | head -1)/bin/sign_update --help
```

The private key is not exported to disk by default.

**Where the public key lives:** `Resources/Info.plist`, key `SUPublicEDKey`.
This value is committed to the repo and is not secret.

**Recovery / rotation:** see §5c and §6.

---

## 3. Step-by-step release flow

Packaging, downloadable publication, and live-update promotion are separate operations.
The scripts never stop the running app or bypass main's required pull-request review.
Any separately authorized development installation uses `scripts/dev-deploy-fleet.sh`.

> **After any FluidAudio (or engine) version bump, run the replay canaries first:**
> `python3 scripts/replay-regression.py --canaries` (optionally `--corpus 40` for a
> broader sweep). The 3s trailing-silence pad compensates for a truncation quirk in
> the FluidAudio/CoreML decode path — it does not reproduce on other runtimes and its
> pad response is non-monotonic (2.0s ok / 2.5s truncated / 3.0s ok, measured
> 2026-06-12) — so an engine upgrade can silently re-break tail clauses. The canaries
> replay the original failing clip and assert the clause survives.

1. Prepare the version, accurate release notes, and Pages changelog on `main`,
   `release/X.Y.Z`, or `codex/release/X.Y.Z`. Commit all tracked changes. Keep the
   source commit SHA; this is the eventual release tag target.
2. Run relevant tests and strict lint. Run `bash scripts/build.sh`. It checks source
   version agreement, builds a fresh retained staging bundle, validates vendored
   libraries, stamps the full source SHA, signs with Developer ID, creates and
   notarizes/staples the DMG, then generates the signed appcast. The full version
   check runs afterward. It performs no install, app stop, push, or release upload.
3. Inspect the actual DMG: signature, notarization, bundled dependency paths, CLI
   startup and relevant smoke tests. Commit generated appcast/Pages metadata.
4. Push the candidate branch. Create and push `vX.Y.Z` pointing at the exact source
   SHA from step 1, not the default branch or a guessed latest commit. Verify the
   remote tag resolves to that SHA. Upload a draft with:
   `gh release create vX.Y.Z speakfree-X.Y.Z.dmg --repo definitelyreal/speakfree --verify-tag --draft --title "speakfree vX.Y.Z" --notes-file docs/release-notes/vX.Y.Z.md`.
5. With publication authorized, run `bash scripts/publish-release.sh X.Y.Z --binary-only`.
   It verifies the source tag and GitHub asset digest before making the download
   public. This intentionally leaves GitHub's latest release unchanged, preserving
   the old site's latest/download URL until reviewed metadata is deployed.
6. Open a PR to main containing the candidate and signed appcast. Obtain the required
   independent review and passing CI. Do not use an administrative merge unless the
   repository owner explicitly authorizes it for this release after those checks;
   never weaken the repository's protection settings.
   The new site uses a version-specific URL so Pages and latest cannot race.
7. After merge and Pages deployment, use a clean main checkout matching GitHub and
   retain the original DMG. Run `bash scripts/publish-release.sh X.Y.Z` to promote
   latest. It requires the actual live appcast and website to reference this release.
   Verify the public asset, website, and Sparkle feed before claiming auto-update live.

### Sparkle bin discovery in build.sh

`build.sh` discovers the installed Sparkle cask version at runtime rather
than hardcoding a path.  See §4 for how this works.  If the Sparkle cask is
not installed the script exits with a clear error message before touching
any artifacts.

---

## 4. Version-bump and appcast flow

### Three sources that must agree

`scripts/check-version.sh` enforces agreement between these three sources at
build time and in CI:

| Source | Location | How to update |
|--------|----------|---------------|
| Swift constant | `Sources/SpeakFreeLib/Version.swift` | Edit the `version` string literal |
| Info.plist | `Resources/Info.plist` | Edit `CFBundleShortVersionString` + `CFBundleVersion` |
| Appcast | `docs/appcast.xml` | Written automatically by `build.sh` — do not hand-edit |

### Version bump procedure

1. Edit `Sources/SpeakFreeLib/Version.swift`: change the `version` string.
2. Edit `Resources/Info.plist`: update both `CFBundleShortVersionString` and
   `CFBundleVersion` to match.
3. `docs/appcast.xml` is rewritten by `build.sh` — do not pre-edit it.
4. Update the Pages version/download surfaces and top changelog entry. Confirm:
   `bash scripts/check-version.sh --source-only` exits 0. The full check must pass
   after packaging generates the real signed appcast; never invent its signature.
5. Commit: `git commit -m "build: bump version to X.Y.Z"`.

### Appcast update

`build.sh` fully rewrites `docs/appcast.xml` with the new version, download
URL, DMG byte length, EdDSA signature, and publish date.  It does NOT push
this file. Commit it with the updated `docs/index.html` download button and submit
both through the reviewed PR. `publish-release.sh` never commits or pushes main.

---

## 5. Recovering credentials from scratch

The instructions below assume the release machine's keychain was lost or you
are setting up a new machine.

### 5a. Developer ID certificate

1. Open **Xcode → Settings → Accounts** and add the Apple ID
   `michael@definitelyreal.com` (or the account associated with team
   `AZ53Y7V4UZ`).
2. Under Manage Certificates, click **+** → **Developer ID Application**.
   Xcode creates a new private key and requests a certificate from Apple.
3. Alternatively, revoke and re-issue from the
   [Apple Developer portal](https://developer.apple.com/account/resources/certificates/list)
   then import the `.cer` + the private key (if the key still exists in the
   original keychain, export it as `.p12` first).
4. Verify:
   ```
   security find-certificate -c "Developer ID Application: Michael Morgenstern"
   ```

### 5b. Notarization profile (`speakfree-notary`)

Apple recommends App Store Connect API keys for notarization (not app-specific
passwords) because they don't expire.

1. Visit [App Store Connect → Users and Access → Integrations → API](https://appstoreconnect.apple.com/access/api).
2. Create a key with the **Developer** role.  Download the `.p8` file
   (available only once).
3. Note the **Key ID** and **Issuer ID** shown on the same page.
4. Run:
   ```
   xcrun notarytool store-credentials "speakfree-notary" \
     --key /path/to/AuthKey_XXXX.p8 \
     --key-id XXXX \
     --issuer "xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx"
   ```
5. Validate:
   ```
   xcrun notarytool store-credentials --validate \
     --keychain-profile speakfree-notary
   ```

Alternatively, with an app-specific password:
```
xcrun notarytool store-credentials "speakfree-notary" \
  --apple-id "michael@definitelyreal.com" \
  --team-id AZ53Y7V4UZ \
  --password "xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx"
```

### 5c. Sparkle EdDSA key

If the private key was lost AND you do not have a backup, you must rotate the
key (see §6 — it requires a one-time forced update to push the new public key
to all existing users).

If you have the private key from a backup `.p12` or a keychain export:
1. Import it: `security import <backup.p12>` into the login keychain.
2. Verify `sign_update` can still sign:
   ```
   /opt/homebrew/Caskroom/sparkle/$(ls /opt/homebrew/Caskroom/sparkle | head -1)/bin/sign_update <any-dmg>
   ```
   It should print an `edSignature=` line.

---

## 6. Sparkle key rotation

Rotate only when the private key is lost or compromised.  Rotating breaks
auto-update for users on old public keys until they manually reinstall.

1. Generate a new key pair:
   ```
   /opt/homebrew/Caskroom/sparkle/$(ls /opt/homebrew/Caskroom/sparkle | head -1)/bin/generate_keys
   ```
   Output includes the new public key (base64).

2. Update `Resources/Info.plist`: replace the `SUPublicEDKey` value with the
   new public key.

3. Commit the `Info.plist` change to main.

4. For the first release after rotation, all users whose copy still has the
   old public key will need to manually download and install the DMG.  Add a
   prominent notice in the GitHub release notes.

5. After the rotation release ships, subsequent releases sign with the new key
   automatically.

## 7. Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Likely cause | Fix |
|---------|--------------|-----|
| `FATAL: extracted Sparkle signature looks invalid` | `sign_update` failed or no private key in keychain | Run `sign_update <dmg>` manually; check keychain for the EdDSA private key |
| `notarytool submit` fails with "The credentials provided are not valid" | Profile stale or wrong team | Re-run `notarytool store-credentials` (§5b) |
| `codesign: no identity found` | Developer ID cert missing from keychain | Re-import certificate (§5a) |
| `FATAL: speakfree links a whisper/ggml or Homebrew dylib` | `Package.swift` or the modulemap links whisper dynamically again | Link whisper only through the `whisper` binary target (`scripts/vendor/whisper.xcframework`) |
| `build.sh: Sparkle cask not installed` | Sparkle cask removed or never installed | `brew install --cask sparkle` |
| Sparkle cask deprecated warning | Cask `sparkle` is flagged as deprecated in brew | The cask is only used for its `sign_update` binary; the deprecation does not affect the release binary. If the cask is removed, copy `sign_update`/`generate_keys` from a known-good version or download directly from the [Sparkle GitHub releases](https://github.com/sparkle-project/Sparkle/releases). |
