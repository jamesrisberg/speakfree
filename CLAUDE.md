# speakfree — project instructions

## Active release lane

This is `codex/release-readiness`, based on the existing app at `1d86b3a`.
Read [RELEASE-READINESS.ai.md](docs/RELEASE-READINESS.ai.md) before editing or releasing.
Experimental accuracy/corpus/engine work is in sibling `../speakfree` on
`codex/accuracy-research`. Keep this release independent; do not merge that branch wholesale.

## Replacing the installed app (MANDATORY)

**Always DELETE the existing `speakfree.app` before copying a new build in. Never copy over / replace it in place.**

Replacing the bundle in place leaves stale files and corrupts TCC (Microphone / Accessibility) permission state, so the rebuilt app can hang, lose its menu-bar icon, or silently fail to record.

Correct sequence when installing a fresh build to `/Applications` (or `~/Applications`):
1. Prepare the build and transfers first. Before any agent-driven stop/restart, require
   no active dictation and at least 30 seconds since the last dictation, then play a tone
   and show a visible cancellable warning. New activity resets the wait. Use the guarded
   fleet deployment flow; cancel, uncertainty, timeout, or failure to exit must abort the
   update, never trigger SIGKILL. This is Michael's explicit September 13 requirement.
   Only after this preparation may the running instance receive a graceful stop.
2. Delete the old bundle: move it to the Trash (`/usr/bin/trash /Applications/speakfree.app`), do not `cp` over it.
3. Copy the new bundle in: `cp -R speakfree.app /Applications/speakfree.app`

## Build / install for local testing

- **Fleet rule (Michael, 2026-07-22): every dev redeploy goes to ALL THREE Macs** — M3 (this machine), M5 (`movie@STUDIO_TAILSCALE_HOST`), M1 (`ark` in ~/.ssh/config). Use `bash scripts/dev-deploy-fleet.sh` (builds, bundles, installs locally, ships vendored bundles to the remotes with the trash-then-copy sequence).
- Release build: `swift build -c release` (or `xcrun swift build -c release`).
- Bundle: `bash scripts/bundle-app.sh .build/release/speakfree speakfree.app dev`. whisper.cpp 1.8.3 + ggml 0.9.5 are linked statically from `scripts/vendor/whisper.xcframework` (rebuilt by `scripts/vendor/build-whisper-xcframework.sh`), so the bundle runs on any Apple silicon Mac without Homebrew. The signed release `.dmg` (via `scripts/build.sh`) additionally bundles `whisper-cli` and the `scripts/vendor/dylibs` it loads, for the CLI fallback.
- The dev bundle is ad-hoc signed (version "dev"): first launch needs **right-click → Open**, and TCC permissions (Mic/Accessibility) may need re-granting after each rebuild.
- To run the CLI build directly: `./.build/debug/speakfree <cmd>`.

## Menu-bar title must reflect build/mode (MANDATORY)

**The menu-bar dropdown title must always tell Michael which build he's running, so an experimental/test build is never mistaken for the dogfood release.** (2026-07-02: production relaunched via launch-at-login and fought the streaming build for the fn hotkey; it wasn't obvious which was which, and one silently wasn't recording.)

Implemented in `SpeakFree.menuTitle` ([Version.swift](Sources/SpeakFreeLib/Version.swift)), rendered as the disabled title item in `StatusBarController.buildMenuItems`:
- **Streaming variant** (bundle id `…​.streaming`) → `SpeakFree Streaming X.Y.Z Testing`
- **Beta variant** (`…​.beta`) → `SpeakFree Beta X.Y.Z Testing`
- **Production** → `speakfree X.Y.Z Testing` for local dev builds; clean `speakfree X.Y.Z` ONLY for the released DMG, which `scripts/build.sh` stamps with Info.plist `SFBuildChannel = release`.

Rule of thumb: dogfooding the real release = clean title; anything you built to test = "Testing". Keep this behavior when touching the menu or the release flow.

## Parakeet model download

- Default new-user engine is Parakeet English (`parakeet-tdt-0.6b-v2`); models cache at `~/Library/Application Support/FluidAudio/Models/parakeet-tdt-0.6b-v{2,3}/`.
- The onboarding download modal (`WelcomeController`) is shown from `AppDelegate.setupInner`, which runs off-main. It MUST be presented via the main run loop (`CFRunLoopPerformBlock`), NOT `DispatchQueue.main.sync` — a modal launched from a main-queue dispatch block starves all other main-queue work, freezing the download UI at 0% and hanging the install. See [project_parakeet_download_progress](memory).
