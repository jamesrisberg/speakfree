//
// Help content as DATA, separate from the window that renders it
// ([HelpController.swift]). The previous Help was one hardcoded attributed string built
// inside the window initializer, and every fact in it had gone stale: it documented
// Whisper-only models while the default engine is Parakeet, named punctuation modes
// ("Hybrid", "Off", "Spoken words") that no longer exist in the picker, and pointed at a
// "Settings → Max Recordings" control that was replaced by the opt-in recordings toggle.
// See build/26-07-26-help-audit/AUDIT.ai.md.
//
// Two rules keep it honest:
//   1. Anything the app already knows (version, build channel, dev mode, the hotkey the
//      user actually has, which engine is selected) is read from `HelpFacts`, not typed
//      into prose, so it cannot drift.
//   2. Control names, the model list, and the engine defaults are pinned by
//      HelpWindowTests against the real Settings UI and EngineCatalog.
