        // quick tap, not a hold.
        //

        // A redundant DOWN is deliberately absorbed here rather than treated as evidence of a
        // release we missed. Two rounds of adversarial review on 2026-07-26 settled this, and
        // both halves cost a rewrite to learn:
        //
        //   - It is NOT proof of a missed release. A version of this code assumed it was, on the
        //     grounds that hardware cannot repeat a down without an up between. Commit d2f47dd
        //     disproves that: a spurious fn-up followed by an fn-down IN THE SAME SECOND, while
        //     the key was held continuously, truncating two dictations mid-clause. The guard
        //     above swallows that up, so the flap's down lands right here. Ending the take on it
        //     re-creates precisely the bug d2f47dd fixed, and
        //     `testPhantomUpIsSwallowedButTheRealReleaseStillEndsTheTake` pins against it. The
        //     hardware read cannot separate the two cases: the key is physically down in both,
        //     still held during a flap and freshly pressed after an outage. (`phantomUpStreak`
        //     plus `modifierPressedAt` could separate them by timing. That was tried and is not
        //     worth it — see the cost asymmetry at the bottom of this comment. The point is that
        //     acting on this event buys little and risks a truncated dictation.)
        //   - The case that reasoning was reaching for, a release lost while the tap was blind,
        //     belongs to `reconcilePressedState`, which asks the HARDWARE whether the key is
        //     still held and so can only ever end a take that is genuinely over. As of
        //     2026-08-11 it fires from every path that loses or replaces the tap: the 5-in-10s
        //     rebuild, the tap-disable re-enable, the global-monitor fallback, `ensureTapHealthy`'s
        //     re-enable and recreate branches (reached by the 30s health poll, which is no longer
        //     gated off during a take), every rung of `startEventTap`'s retry ladder plus its
        //     success path, and the sleep-wake / fast-user-switch resume handlers. `stop()`
        //     force-ends an in-flight take outright — a stopped manager can never deliver the
        //     release. THREE residual gaps, all deliberate or pre-existing: (1) a healthy-looking
        //     tap with a stuck `modifierPressed` (this fall-through's phantom-swallow edge) is NOT
        //     reconciled by the poll, so a hardware misread cannot truncate a live take; that case
        //     costs the extra tap(s) described below. (2) Non-modifier ("Other…") hotkeys never
        //     set `modifierPressed` (handleNSEvent calls the callbacks directly), so the whole
        //     watchdog — reconcile AND stop()'s force-end — is inert for them; a release lost
        //     while their global monitor is down is still stranded until the next press. Fixing
        //     that needs pressed-state tracking plus a keyState-based hardware read for regular
        //     keycodes — separate work. (3) `modifierPressed` is an unsynchronized Bool with
        //     tap-thread and main-thread writers, so two racing reconcile paths can both dispatch
        //     onKeyUp; the user-visible double-stop is prevented by `guard isRecording` in
        //     DictationSession.stopRecording, not by anything in this file.
        //
        // Worst case if a release is missed and no reconcile path fires, walked in both modes:
        // in HOLD mode the next release is honored normally and the take ends one tap later. In
        // TOGGLE mode it costs TWO taps, and the first one is silent: the down is absorbed here,
        // the up hits `handleKeyUp` which returns early in toggle mode, and only the SECOND down
        // reaches `handleKeyDown` to stop the take. A stuck hardware read stretches that to five
        // taps before the streak cap forces the release through. Bounded either way — a take
        // cannot run indefinitely — and the alternative is a dictation cut off mid-sentence.
