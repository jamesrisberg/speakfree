    // MARK: - Clipboard restore after a dictation paste (2026-08-14)
    //
    // A dictation paste borrows the clipboard: write the text, Cmd+V, then hand the user's
    // clipboard back. The old fixed 0.3s restore was too short for a busy Electron app (Codex
    // mid-agent-run) to read the pasteboard first, dropping ~1-4% of pastes. This uses a per-app
    // backstop timer instead: long (3s) on Electron/remote where consumption can lag, short (0.3s)
    // on native where Cmd+V is synchronous.
    //
    // Design note: an earlier version added a "restore on the user's next Command press" trigger to
    // make the backstop feel instant. Three independent adversarial reviews (2026-08-14) killed it:
    // a Command press (Cmd+Tab, Cmd+C, not just Cmd+V) between the paste and the app's actual read
    // restores the clipboard out from under the still-unconsumed paste, causing the app to paste the
    // user's PRIOR clipboard (possibly sensitive) into the target — worse than a drop. There is no
    // way to know the app has consumed, so early restore is never safe. Backstop only.

    /// What to hand back and the guard that says it is still safe to. `savedItems` is the user's
    /// clipboard from BEFORE the first un-restored dictation paste (never re-snapshotted while a
    /// restore is pending AND the clipboard is still our text, or a rapid second dictation would
