//
// T2.1 — Adaptive post-buffer.
//
// The app keeps recording for a short window AFTER the dictation key is released, so the tail of
// the last word (still sitting in an AVAudioEngine buffer) isn't clipped. Historically this was a
// FLAT 300 ms wait applied to EVERY dictation — a tax paid even when the speaker had already gone
// silent before lifting the key.
//
// This file is the PURE decision: "given the RMS of each fixed-length window of trailing audio,
// how long should I keep recording before finalizing?" It has no I/O, no audio framework, no clock
// — just arithmetic over `[Float]` window-RMS values — so it is exhaustively unit-testable
// (silence-immediately / speech-until-release / speech-past-release). DictationSession drives it by
// chopping the post-release audio into windows and polling `decideWaitMs`; the perf harness drives
// it over fixture tails to measure the latency win.
//
// Reuses the SAME RMS notion the audio tap already computes (AudioRecorder.handleAudioBuffer:
// sqrtf(Σx² / n)) so "silence" here means the same thing the visualizer + dead-audio check mean.
//
// SCOPE OF THE WIN (AR-2 round-2, measured): this only shaves latency when the user goes silent
// BEFORE releasing the key (trailing audio at/below the 0.01 RMS floor). On recordings whose tail
// is still spoken word, the policy correctly pays the full cap — no clipping, no win. On the
// golden corpus exactly one fixture (the manufactured trailing-silence canary) early-stops, so the
// corpus-aggregate median benefit is ~0%; the real-world benefit is the fraction of dictations
// that end in a quiet tail. It is hard-capped at the legacy flat wait, so it is never worse.
// See AdaptiveBufferCorpusTests for the tests that pin this reality.

/// Decision rule (cap-bounded, silence-terminated):
///   * Walk the trailing-audio windows in capture order.
///   * A window is "silent" when its RMS is at or below `silenceThreshold` (`≤`); a window exactly
///     at the threshold counts as silence.
///   * A CONTIGUOUS silent suffix must reach `silenceNeededMs` of audio — return the elapsed time
///     at which that current suffix met the target. Later speech invalidates an earlier pause.
///   * Never wait longer than `capMs` (never worse than the legacy 300 ms flat wait — the retuned
///     220 ms cap is strictly below it).
///   * If silence is observed from the very first window, the wait collapses toward
///     `silenceNeededMs` instead of the full cap.
///   * If the windows run out before a full silence run (or before the cap), fall back to `capMs` —
///     the last-word-clipping guard: when in doubt, wait the full amount. Post-retune that fallback
///     waits the new 220 ms cap (down from 300 ms), still the conservative worst case. (Live: the
///     caller keeps polling as more windows arrive until silence is met or the cap is hit.)
