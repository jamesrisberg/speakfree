//
// T2.3 — Reuse the last streaming partial for short utterances.
//
// When a user releases the hotkey very shortly after the live-preview ("streaming") pass last
// completed, AND the recording has barely grown since that pass, the already-computed streaming
// partial is OFTEN close to what a fresh FINAL inference would produce. In that window we can
// SKIP the redundant final `whisper_full` call and route the saved partial through the SAME
// TextPipeline post-processing the final pass uses — eliminating the final inference latency for
// short utterances.
//
// This type is the PURE decision: it owns no app state, touches no engine, and is unit-testable
// headless. `DictationSession.finalizeRecording` snapshots the live numbers and asks `decide(...)`.
//
// ACCURACY CAVEAT (AR-2 findings #1, #2): the streaming partial is computed with `prompt: nil` and
// NO VAD trim, whereas the final pass it replaces is glossary/cursor/screen-context-PRIMED, VAD-
// trimmed, AND transcribed over MORE audio (the gate permits up to `defaultMaxSampleGrowthFraction`
// of post-pass growth the streamed partial never saw). The original T2.3-PRE gate measured only a
// thread-count difference on degenerate 2–3 s slices (hallucination markers / empty strings) and
// reported 0.000% divergence — agreement on noise, not signal. The growth+prompt-aware reuse
// harness (`perf-harness reuse`, AR-2 R1) re-measures ALL three axes (audio growth, initial prompt,
// thread count) and reports word divergence well above the locked <1% threshold. The plan's rule is
// "if divergence is high, T2.3 is cancelled" — so this is DEFAULT OFF.
//
// Kill-switch: gated by `config.reuseStreamingPartial` (FlexBool, DEFAULT OFF — opt-in only). When
// the flag is off — or any gate condition fails — the decision is `.runFinalInference` and behavior
// is byte-identical to pre-T2.3.
